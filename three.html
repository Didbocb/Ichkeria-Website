      <p>All Moscow’s attempts to topple Dudaev with military support from the Communist opposition (i.e. the former Communists), by imposing an economic blockade and by blocking transport routes remained unsuccessful. The ground was prepared for war with a great deal of invective the Russian media. The war began on 11 December 1994.</p>
      <p>On 22 April Chechnya’s first President Dzhokhar Dudaev was killed by a cruise missile and the Chechen writer Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was appointed as his successor. While Yandarbiyev and the former Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin were in the Kremlin signing a ceasefire agreement, Yeltsin flew to Grozny, declared victory over the Chechen rebels and announced parliamentary elections.

      <p>But these pseudo-elections for a puppet government were followed in August 1996 by a major Chechen offensive, notably on Grozny, where 1,000 Russian soldiers found themselves under siege. Air raids and shelling again prompted thousands of civilians to flee Grozny. But the Chechen advance could no longer be halted. General Lebed, the Commissioner for Chechnya, prevented the all-out defeat of the Russian Army and on 31 August he signed an agreement in Khassav-Yurt (Dagestan) on the basis for relations between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic. Russian troops withdrew. Although there were acts of sabotage, as when six International Red Cross workers were murdered in Novy Atagi, but on 27 January 1997 presidential and parliamentary elections were held under the aegis of the OSCE. As 72 election observers and 200 journalists watched, Aslan Maskhadov was elected with 59.3% of the vote. Yeltsin phoned to congratulate him.</p>

      <p>On 12 May 1997 Presidents Maskhadov and Yeltsin signed a peace agreement in Moscow, thereby indirectly recognising Chechnya’s sovereignty.</p>

      <h2 id="section2">Documentary: The Betrayed (1995)</h2>
      <p>Documentary Description: As Russian tanks advance over the plains of Chechnya, a group of Russian mothers search for the conscript sons they believe have been captured by the Chechens.
