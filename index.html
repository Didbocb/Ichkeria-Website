      <h2 id="section0">Welcome to the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria</h2>
      <p>The Chechen Republic Ichkeria, also known as Chechnya or the Chechen Republic, is located in the Southeastern part of North Caucasus, is an independent country since 1991 after the collapse of the USSR (The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) but under Russian occupation since 1999.</p>

      <h2 id="section1">Geography</h2>
      <p>The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria is on the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus and in the adjoining Chechen plain and Terek-Kuma lowlands. The total land area of Chechnya is about 19,300 sq km. Chechnya is surrounded on nearly all sides by the Russian Federation. In the West, it borders North Ossetia and Ingushetia; in the North, Stavropol Krai; in the East, Dagestan; and to the South, Georgia. The capital of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria is Dzhokhar Ghala also known as Grozny.

      Chechnya can be divided into four parts: plains, foothills, mountains and highlands. In the Northern and Northeastern parts of Chechnya there are sandy steppes. Northwestern, Western, central and Eastern parts of Chechnya are covered by plains and foothills. The Southern and Southeastern parts of Chechnya lie in the Greater Caucasus mountain range, forming a series of valleys.</p>

      <h2 id="section2">Administrative Divisons</h2>
      <p>As mentioned before, the capital of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria is Dzhokhar Ghala (Grozny). The city lies on the Sunzha River. Dzhokhar Ghala is divided into four administrative city districts: Leninsky, Zavodskoy, Staropromyslovsky and Oktyabrsky.

      The city was founded in 1818 as a fortress. The Groznaya Fortress was a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River by Terek Cossacks which was a prominent defense centre during the Caucasian War. It was built on the site of six leveled Chechen villages. After the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire, the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and in December 1869 it was renamed Grozny. In Russian “Grozny” means “fearsome”, “menacing”, or “terrible”.

      Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who was the Vice-President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, renamed the city Dzhokhar Ghala in 1996. After the assassination of Dzhokhar Dudaev by the Russians in 1996, consequently, Yandarbiyev became the acting President.</p>

      <h2 id="section3">The Flag, Emblem and Anthem</h2>
      <p>The flag of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI) was recognized after 1990. The color scheme of the flag is green, white and red; the upper two thirds of the flag are in green and the remaining one third in white, red, white and green stripes of equal width. Each color is meant to symbolize an aspect of the Chechen national character. The green color of the flag symbolizes Islam, red symbolizes the bloodshed in the struggle for freedom and white represents the road to a bright future. Another design of the flag is similar to this flag but has the country’s coat of arms incorporated into the design. Ratios of ChRI flag are 8:1:1:1:1.</p>

        <p><b>Death or Freedom</b></p>
          <p>We were born at night when the she-wolf whelped,
            In the morning, to lion’s deafening roar, they named us
            There is no God except Allah

            In eagles’ nests our mothers nursed us,
            To tame wild bulls our fathers taught us.
            There is no God except Allah

            Our mothers raised us to dedicate ourselves to our Nation and our Homeland,
            And if our nation needs us we’re ready to fight the oppressive hand.
            There is no God except Allah

            We grew up free as eagles, princes of the mountains.
            There is no threshold from which we will shy away.
            There is no God except Allah

            Sooner will cliffs of granite begin to melt like molten lead,
            Than any one of us shall lose our honour in life’s struggles.
            There is no God except Allah

            Sooner shall the Earth be swallowed up by the broiling sun,
            Than we emerge from a trial in life without our honour!
            There is no God except Allah

            Never to bow our heads to anyone, we give our sacred pledge,
            To die or to live in freedom is our fate.
            There is no God except Allah

            Our sisters heal our brothers’ bloody wounds with their songs,
            Lovers’ eyes will supply the strength of arms.
            There is no God except Allah

            If hunger weaken us, we’ll gnaw on the roots of trees,
            And if thirst debilitates us, we’ll drink the dew from the grass.
            There is no God except Allah

            For we were born at night when the she-wolf whelped.
            We pledge our lives to God, Nation and Vainakh homeland.
            There is no God except Allah
